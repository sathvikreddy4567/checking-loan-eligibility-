# checking-loan-eligibility-
 Made a simple checking loan eligibility by using some conditions 
 I built a Loan Eligibility Checker using Python that analyzes a user’s financial details and determines whether they qualify for a loan. The program collects key inputs such as monthly income, credit score and loan amount

Using these values, it applies a set of predefined conditions and arithmetic checks  to evaluate loan eligibility. The system then displays whether the applicant is Eligible or Not Eligible, along with clear reasons.

This project helped me practice:

Python conditional statements (if–elif–else)

Arithmetic operators for calculating EMI ratios and limits

User input handling

Logical decision-making in real-life scenarios

Building interactive console applications

It simulates how banks perform basic loan screening and can be further improved with GUI, real datasets, or machine learning models.
